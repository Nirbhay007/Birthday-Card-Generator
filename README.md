# Birthday Page Generator

I built this **Birthday Page Generator** to help people create ultra-smooth, visually rich, and personalized birthday microsites for their loved ones. It's designed to be mobile-first and incredibly interactive.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to create a way to send a digital birthday card that feels premium and special, not just a static image. This project allows users to:
- **Create a personalized page** with a recipient's name, photo, and message.
- **Interactive Candle Blowing**: I implemented a microphone-based interaction where you can physically blow into your phone's mic to extinguish the candles on the screen!
- **Premium Aesthetics**: I focused heavily on smooth animations, glassmorphism, and vibrant color palettes.

## How It Works

1. **Create**: Enter the birthday person's details and upload photos.
2. **Preview**: See exactly what they will see in real-time.
3. **Share**: Generate a unique link to send to them.

## Tech Stack

I used the following technologies to bring this to life:
- **Next.js**: For the framework and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, beautiful styling.
- **Framer Motion**: To add those buttery smooth animations.
- **Canvas Confetti**: For the celebration effects.
- **Web Audio API**: For the candle blowing detection.

## Getting Started

If you want to run my project locally:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

I hope you enjoy using this tool as much as I enjoyed building it!
